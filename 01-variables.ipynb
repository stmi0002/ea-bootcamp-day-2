    "Within a programming workflow, variables store data (i.e. information) that you want to re-use in your code (e.g. a single value, list of values, a filename, or path to a directory). \n",
    "\n",
    "In `Python`, variables can be created without defining the type of data that it will hold (e.g. whole numbers, text string). This differs from many other programming languages that require the variable to be explicitly assigned a data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "A variable can contain a single value - such as a whole number (i.e. integer), decimal, or text string - or it can contain a list of values. In this lesson, you will work with variables that store single data values. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a variable to store a single numeric value by defining a name and assigning a value to that name using the equal (`=`) operator (e.g. `variablename = 1.5`). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the value is a text string, you need to add parenthesis (`\"\"`) around the value, so that `Python` knows it is a text string (e.g. `variablename = \"text\"`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you want to use good naming conventions for directories on your computer, you also want to assign clear and short names to variables, avoiding spaces or complicated wording, but still specific enough that you know what it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a variable containing the average annual precipitation in millimeters (mm) for Boulder, Colorado could simply be called `precip`. "
